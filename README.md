# Weather Application

Creating a simple weather application using JSON, Ajax and CSS.

- Build a form with an input textbox and a button
- Pass the following parameters as an Object through to the host
  - 'q':city  // the city you live in
  - 'units':'metric'  // or some other unit
  - 'APPID':'6dec5fb891e6e243c9d8c20351998e67'  // a key
- Check the date that returns, how do we get the current temp?
- What other kind of data is useful? Built the interface to house it
- Tie the search to the button using an event
- Take the city name from the input text area
- Update the interface to be coloured according to the temperature

For fun:
- Create an element with the class of time to see a live clock show up (time.js)
